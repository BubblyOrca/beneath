Beneath is a serverless DataOps platform that aims to combine data storage, processing, and visualization with data quality management and governance.

_Beneath is a work in progress and your input makes a big difference! Star the project to show your support or [reach out](https://about.beneath.dev/contact) and tell us what you think._

## üß† Philosophy

The holy grail of data work is putting data science into production. It's glorious to behold a live dashboard that aggregates multiple data sources, send real-time alerts based on a machine learning model, or offer customer-specific analytics in your frontend. But building a modern data management stack is a full-time job, and a lot can go wrong. If we were starting a project from scratch today, we would set up Postgres, BigQuery, Kafka, Airflow, DBT and Metabase just to cover the basics. Then we'd start thinking about data quality management, data cataloging, data versioning, data lineage, permissions management, change data capture, stream processing, and so on, and so on.

Beneath is a new way of building data apps and services. We're taking an end-to-end approach that combines data storage, processing, and visualization with data quality management and governance in one platform. Our idea is to provide one opinionated layer of abstraction, accessible through client libraries and a web console, that in turn builds on existing data technologies.

We're inspired by services like Netlify and Vercel that make it remarkable easy for developers to build and run web apps. In that same spirit, we want to give data scientists and engineers a better developer experience to deploy, monitor, enrich, visualize, integrate, and share analytics.

## üê£ Get started

The best way to try Beneath is with a free beta account. When you sign up, you'll be guided to installing the Python SDK and setting up your first project. [Sign up here](https://beneath.dev/?noredirect=1).

We're working on bundling a self-hosted version that you can run locally. If you're interested in self-hosting, [contact us](https://about.beneath.dev/contact) and let us know!

## üöÄ Status

<!-- Getting there is a journey and we're starting with data storage in the form of streams you can replay, subscribe to, query with SQL, monitor, and share. Streams are the primitive the rest of our roadmap builds upon. -->
