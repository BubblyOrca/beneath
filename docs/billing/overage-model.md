For the Professional and Enterprise plans, you are allotted monthly quotas for both Reads and Writes. At the beginning of each month, you are charged your plan's base price. At the end of the month, if your Read or Write usage exceeds your monthly quota, then you will be charged an "overage" fee. 

The fee is simply calculated for both Reads and Writes:<br>
overageFee = (usageGB - quotaGB) * overagePricePerGB
