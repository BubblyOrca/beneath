This directory contains all the documentation files display on [https://about.beneath.dev/docs/](https://about.beneath.dev/docs/).

### Read before editing

- Each folder becomes a section of the documentation
- The front-matter in the `_index.md` file gives the title and weight (order) of the section
- The body in `_index.md` becomes the content for the section overview page
- The `menu.docs.parent` key in the front matter of every non-index file must match the parent folder
