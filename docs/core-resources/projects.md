Projects are collections of Beneath streams and models. A project is analogous to a GitHub repository. 

##### Permissions
Projects can either be public or private. Additionally, role-based access controls allow project admins to grant project members specific permissions (admin, contributor, view-only).

##### CLI commands
With the CLI, you can do the following:

- list projects
- create a project
- update a project
- delete a project

See the manual:
```bash
beneath project -h
```
