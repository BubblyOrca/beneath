##### What is Beneath?
Beneath is unified data infrastructure for analytics applications. Beneath's infrastructure encompasses the full data lifecycle: data ingress, stream processing, data storage, and data egress. By building with Beneath, data workers no longer spend time on data engineering -- instead, they focus on their data and analytics.

Additionally, Beneath is the easiest way to share live streaming data with multiple parties.
And since many users opt to share their data publically, Beneath functions as one massive open data repository. Like a GitHub for data.

##### What is Beneath best used for?
Beneath is for any data rich organization that wants to deliver more analytics to its users. Beneath especially shines if:

-  Your organization's existing data pipelines are a complicated mess. They shouldn't be.
-  You want to exchange data and analytics with outside parties. Easily and in realtime.
-  You're a data-driven startup and want a future-proof data system up-and-running ASAP.
-  You're a data scientist and you want an easier API for replaying and syncing data streams.
<!-- -  You have a multi-person data team, or your organization is marked by data silos, and you want to eliminate duplicate work. -->
-  You have a multi-person data team and you want to eliminate duplicate work.
-  Your organization is redundantly consuming data from an API, and you'd rather just do it once.

##### What are Beneath's guiding data philosophies?
<em>Production realtime analytics are painful.</em><br>
It's painful for organizations to put their analytics into production. Often data scientists will do ad-hoc work, which is either discarded only to be repeat later, or there will be an "oh no" moment when asked to deploy the analytics to production or to integrate the feature in a larger system.

<em>The database technology space is overwhelmingly complicated.</em><br>
Data technologies have proliferated over the past decade, but to use the new technology, developers have had to become data engineering experts. Developers should focus on what makes their company unique, not on data pipeline technicalities.

<em>It should be easy to exchange data across organizations.</em><br>
Most companies are constrained by the difficulty in sharing data across organizational silos. A wave of innovation will be unleashed with a more open data world.

<!-- <em>Data and analytics should be searchable.</em><br>
You should be able to look up on Google "X data" and find a high quality dataset that a community is building off of. -->
