## Installing the Python library and Beneath CLI
The Python library enables the [Beneath CLI]({{< ref "/docs/managing-resources/cli" >}}), so it's important you install it. From your command line:
```bash
pip3 install beneath
```

## Installing the Javascript libraries
While everyone needs the Python library to enable the Beneath CLI, you'll only need these Javascript libraries if it's your language-of-choice. From your command line: 
```bash
npm install beneath
npm install beneath-react
```

## Start developing!
Next you'll probably want to check out the rest of the [quickstarts]({{< ref "/docs/quick-starts" >}}).
