# Beneath Systems client library

## Overview
- Leverage this library in order to easily write large-scale data into and out of Beneath systems. Let us worry about the data infrastructure so you don't have to :)
- Please reach out to benjamin@beneath.network and eric@beneath.network if you have any questions or feedback. We'd love to help you and make our product easier to use!

## Reading data from Beneath (TODO)
- Read your data from Beneath with one simple command: 
- ReadFromBeneath()

## Applying data transforms with Apache Beam (TODO)
- To handle streaming data at scale, we are leveraging Apache Beam. Beam enables user-friendly stream processing by dynamically scaling its driver cluster to handle high-intensity workloads.
- Currently, in order to leverage Beneath, you need to use Beam too. But don't worry, it's easy!
- We highly recommend checking out the /examples folder to see a walkthrough of Beneath and Beam in action.
- We strive for our Beneath documentation to be sufficient (please tell us if it's not!), but if you would like more Beam resources, check out:

## Writing data to Beneath
- Write your data to Beneath with one simple command: 
- WriteToBeneath()
