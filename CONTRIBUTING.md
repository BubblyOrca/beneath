# Contributing to Beneath

## Bug reports

We appreciate any help in bringing bugs in Beneath to light. If you encounter a bug, please follow these steps:

- Check if someone has already reported the bug by searching existing issues on Gitlab
- If the bug relates to a client library (e.g. the Python library), please report it to the client library maintainers
- File an issue in Gitlab

When you file a bug report, please provide as many details and examples as possible! The more information you give us, the quicker and easier we can solve it for you.

## Feature requests

You can also use Gitlab issues to tell us about new features or changes you want in Beneath. We love to get your input and we use it to prioritize our work. 

When you request new features or changes, please share real-world examples where the feature would be useful. That way, we can better understand what you're trying to achieve and ensure that we fully solve your problem.

## Contributing source code

We welcome any and all contributions to the core Beneath platform.

- To get started developing on to the codebase, consult the `DEVELOPING.md` file. If you need any help, don't hesitate to reach out!
- To submit your contributions, you should fork the repository and make your changes to your fork. When you're done, submit a pull request of your work in this repository. We'll then review your work and work with you to merge it into our master branch.
- If you want to contribute to a client library (e.g. the Python library), you should find the relevant source repository and check out their contributor's guide.
- You should understand that while the Beneath source code is publicly available, we have not yet settled on a public license for the source code. We may not make Beneath available under a permissive open source license, and you should be comfortable with that uncertainty. As part of the contribution process, we will ask you to sign a Contributor's License Agreement (CLA).
