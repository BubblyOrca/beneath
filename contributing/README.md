## Bug reports, questions, and feature requests

To report a bug, request a feature, or ask a question, visit/search the [Issues](https://github.com/beneath-hq/beneath/issues) (when posting, use either the "Bug", "Feature" or "Question" description templates). We love getting your input, so don't hesitate to engage!

## Documentation for contributors

It's our ambition that all information relevant to developing the core Beneath platform is stored as close to the source code as possible, i.e., in this repository.

The documentation for contributors is structured as follows:

- This directory (`contributing/`) provides general information for contributors, including an overview of the codebase and a guideline to setting up a development environment
- The `README.md` file in each subdirectory provides implementation details about the specific module, such as its purpose, design decisions, and notes for contributors

The only files in this repository that are considered user-facing (i.e. _not_ for contributors) are:

- The documentation files in `docs/`
- The `README.md` file at the root of the repository
- The `README.md` files in the `examples/` folder
- The `README.md` files at the root of each client library directory (e.g. `clients/python/`)

## What to work on

We currently mainly expect people with a relationship to our organization to contribute, but if you're interested in contributing to Beneath, we'll welcome you with open arms! Follow these steps to get something to work on:

- First read the [License page](https://github.com/beneath-hq/beneath/blob/master/contributing/08-license.md) to understand the current uncertainty relating to how your work will be licensed
- Browse the [Issues page](https://github.com/beneath-hq/beneath/issues) to find or submit a problem (bugfix or feature) you want to work on
- Comment on the issue and declare your interest in helping out -- we'll then get in touch with you to coordinate your contribution

## Submitting changes

- Before getting started, read through the pages in this folder to learn more about the architecture of the codebase
- You should fork the `beneath` repository and make your changes on your own fork
- When you're done, create a merge request in this repository linking to your fork (noting the issue the merge request relates to)
- We'll review your contributions and work with you to merge it into our master branch
