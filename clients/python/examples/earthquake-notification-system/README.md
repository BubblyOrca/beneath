# Beneath and Twilio example

Here's all the code necessary to create a real-time earthquake notification system.

In the `/earthquakes` folder, you'll find the code that generates the [earthquakes stream](https://beneath.dev/demos/earthquakes/earthquakes).

In the `/notifications` folder, you'll find the code that reads the earthquakes stream and conditionally triggers a notification text message sent via Twilio.
