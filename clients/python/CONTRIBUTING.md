### Autogenerated API reference (docs)

We use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to generate docs for this library based on the files in `docs` and the comments in the source files.

The autogenerated documentation is generated as HTML files in the `clients/python/docs/_build` folder (which is ignored by git). You can generate it locally by running `make docs` (make sure your virtualenv is actived) and opening `docs/_build/index.html` in your browser.

Every time changes are merged and pushed into the `stable` branch, an automatic build and deploy is triggered via Netlify (config in `netlify.toml`). The stable docs are published live at [https://python.docs.beneath.dev/](https://python.docs.beneath.dev/). Click the Netlify badge in `README.md` to see the build status.
