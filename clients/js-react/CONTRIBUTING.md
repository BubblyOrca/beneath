# CONTRIBUTING

### Publishing to NPM

1. Run `yarn install` and `yarn build` to ensure your local copy of the library up-to-date with correct dependencies
2. Update the version number in `package.json`
3. Run `npm publish`

### Autogenerated API reference (docs)

We use [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org/) to autogenerate docs for this library. It loosely uses the documentation format of [tsdoc](https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc).

The autogenerated documentation is generated as HTML files in the `clients/js-react/docs` folder (which is ignored by git). You can generate it locally by running `yarn docs` and opening `docs/index.html` in your browser.

Every time changes are merged and pushed into the `stable` branch, an automatic build and deploy is triggered via Netlify (config in `netlify.toml`). The stable docs are published live at [https://react.docs.beneath.dev/](https://react.docs.beneath.dev/). Click the Netlify badge in `README.md` to see the build status.
