# `clients/`

This directory contains all the language-specific client libraries for interfacing with Beneath from external applications.

They're named after the applicable language (and possibly framework). Each should contain a `README.md` file for external users and be capable of generating documentation (only API reference documentation, i.e., documentation of function calls and their parameters; any examples or tutorials should go in the main Beneath documentation; similar to [how Google does it](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/libraries)).
