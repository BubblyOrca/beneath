# `services/service/`

This service contains functionality for finding and creating services. It's the services service... Yeah, that is CONFUSING! Explainer: In the codebase, a "service" wraps functionality for a specific domain of the app, while in Beneath, a "service" is a *non-user account* (also known as a "service account" in e.g. GCP).
